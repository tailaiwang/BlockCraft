Minecraft: A Java Remake

This is a Minecraft Remake done entirely from scratch! We utilized resources from the Minecraft WIKI to complete this project!

There are two versions of our game. The first is 3-D in with only linear movement, while the other is 3-D
with full angular rotation. The angular rotation version is slightly buggy, so we reccomend running the linear
one for the cleanest experience.

In order to run the file, rename the specified.java file to "test". The other .java file should be named "testOff"
The GDX Desktop Launcher will run the file that is named "test". If they aren't named differently, the reccuring classes 
in the two versions will not allow a launch.
